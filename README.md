# purple-gowhatsapp

A libpurple/Pidgin plugin for WhatsApp **Web**.

Powered by [go-whatsapp](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp), which is written by Lucas Engelke.

Being developed on Ubuntu 18.04.

### Set-up

* Create a new account  
  You can enter an arbitrary username. 
  However, it is recommended to use your own internationalized number, followed by `@s.whatsapp.net`.  
  Example: `123456789` from Germany would use `49123456789@s.whatsapp.net`.  
  This way, Pigin's logs look sane.
* Upon login, a fake conversation should pop up, showing a QR code.  
  Using your phone's camera, scan the code within 20 seconds â€“ just like you would do with the browser-based WhatsApp Web.

Note: The login information is currently stored at `~/.whatsappSession.gob`. This is subject to change.

### Features

### Missing Features

* Allow connection to more than one account
