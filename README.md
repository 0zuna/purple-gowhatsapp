# purple-gowhatsapp

A libpurple/Pidgin plugin for WhatsApp **Web**.

Powered by [go-whatsapp](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp), which is written by Lucas Engelke.

Being developed on Ubuntu 18.04.  
Last seen working with [go-whatsapp d7754af](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp/commit/d7754af).

### Building

* Build using the supplied Makefile.  
  Optional: Try `make update-dep` for the most recent go-whatsapp version.

### Pre-Built Binaries

* Download a [nightly build](https://buildbot.hehoe.de/purple-gowhatsapp/builds/) (Ubuntu 18.04).
* Win32 binaries might be obtained from [EionRobb](https://github.com/EionRobb/purple-gowhatsapp).

### Installation

* Place the binary in your Pidgin's plugin directory (`~/.purple/plugins` on Linux).

### Set-up

* Create a new account  
  You can enter an arbitrary username. 
  However, it is recommended to use your own internationalized number, followed by `@s.whatsapp.net`.  
  Example: `123456789` from Germany would use `49123456789@s.whatsapp.net`.  
  This way, Pidgin's logs look sane.
* Upon login, a fake conversation should pop up, showing a link to a QR code.  
  Using your phone's camera, scan the code within 20 seconds â€“ just like you would do with the browser-based WhatsApp Web.
* Note: Some settings only take effect after a re-connect.

Please also notice the wiki page regarding [common problems](Common-Problems).

### What could be done next
